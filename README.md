# economic-data

Python modules to help read economic data from different sources.

Aims:

* standalone modules for portability without needing to install them, with
  (MIT) licence included
* limited dependencies (ideally just the standard library)
* play well with higher-level readers e.g. standard library `csv`
  module; [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
